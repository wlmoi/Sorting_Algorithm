## Sorting Algorithms in Python

Here you'll find descriptions and time complexities of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python.

### 1. Bubble Sort

**Description:** Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 2. Selection Sort

**Description:** Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 3. Insertion Sort

**Description:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting values into their correct positions.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 4. Merge Sort

**Description:** Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

### 5. Quick Sort

**Description:** Chooses a pivot element, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (average case)

### 6. Bogo Sort

**Description:** Repeatedly shuffles the array until it accidentally becomes sorted.  
**Time Complexity:** Unbounded (can take forever!)

**Note:** Not practical for real-world use.
